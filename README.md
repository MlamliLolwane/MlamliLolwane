## :wave: Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile. 
<br/>

My name is Mlamli Lolwane, a fullstack developer who is passionate about developing scalable, high-performance applications that enhance user experiences and solve real-world problems.

I have 2 years experience working as an IT Technician intern at the North West Department of Health.

Although this program has equipped me with robust technical skills in system diagnostics, network
administration, problem solving as well as people skills, my true passion lies in Software Development. 

I hold a National Diploma in Information Technology (Software Development) from the Nelson Mandela University and aim to use the skills I obtained through the internship as well as my strong academic foundation to smoothly transition and become one of the best software developers in the country. 

I’m actively seeking full-time, contract, or freelance roles in fullstack, backend, or frontend development. If you’re hiring or have an exciting project, let’s connect!
