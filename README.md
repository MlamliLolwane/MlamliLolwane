## :wave: Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile.



My name is Mlamli Lolwane, a fullstack developer whose focus is on building scalable as well as high performance applications. 

I obtained my National Diploma in Information Technology (Software Development) from the Nelson Mandela University.:mortar_board:

## 💻 Tech Stack

Heavy Lifting: [Laravel, ASP.NET Core, Node.js]. <br/>
Nicey Nice: [ReactJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS]. <br/>
Databases: [MySQL, SQL Server, Redis, Mongo DB]. <br/>

<br/>

*I am not only limited to the above mentioned technologies and frameworks as I believe that once you understand
the concepts and logic behind software development, then adopting new technologies, frameworks and tools should be fairly easy.* <br/><br/>
