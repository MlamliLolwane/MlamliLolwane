## ðŸ“Œ What Iâ€™m Working On

I am currently working on the <a href="https://bigodeals.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Big O Deals </a> application which is a platform that compiles the best affiliate marketing links for customers
to offer them access to exclusive discounts and promotions. <br/>

You can view a video demo of the application on [go][my-go-link]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
which will give you an all round view of both the client and admin applications.
Source code to the projects is available on request.
