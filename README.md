### Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile.



My name is Mlamli Lolwane, a fullstack developer from a small town in the North West province called Mahikeng. :wave:

I obtained my National Diploma in Information Technology (Software Development) from the Nelson Mandela University in 2018.:mortar_board:

<br/>

The technologies that I work with are as follows: `[PHP, C#, DartLanguage, VisualBasics, JavaScript, HTML, CSS]`. :hammer:


The frameworks I use include: `[Laravel, ASP.NET, ReactJS, VueJS, Bootstrap]`. :wrench:

<br/>

*I am not only limited to the above mentioned technologies and frameworks as I believe that once you understand
the concepts and logic behind software development, then adopting new technologies, frameworks and tools should not be an uphill walk.* <br/><br/>


#### I am actively job seeking and can be reached on the following platforms:
