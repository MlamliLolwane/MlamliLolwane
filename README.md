## :wave: Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile.



My name is Mlamli Lolwane, a fullstack developer whose focus is on building scalable as well as high performance applications. 

I obtained my National Diploma in Information Technology (Software Development) from the Nelson Mandela University. 

<br/>

## 📌 What I’m Working On

I am currently working on the <a href="https://bigodeals.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Big O Deals application </a> which is a platform that compiles the best affiliate marketing links for customers
to offer them access to exclusive discounts and promotions. <br/>

You can view a video demo of the application on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/MlamliLolwane1)
which will give you an all round view of both the client and admin applications.
Source code to the projects is available on request.
